## Background

Gun violence is a growing epidemic across the U.S., and Americans by-and-large [support moderate gun control](https://www.vox.com/2015/10/3/9444417/gun-violence-mass-shootings-us-america), yet Congress refuses to pass it as legislation. Why the discrepancy?

One answer comes in that the gun lobby directly funds our representatives: the current members of Congress have accepted [$40M from gun rights](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=Q13&recipdetail=A&sortorder=U&cycle=All) groups and [about $8M from gun control](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=Q12&recipdetail=A&sortorder=U&cycle=All) groups (about 2/3 of the latter coming since 2016, half just this year).

  <Stat
    unit="$"
    value={commaNumber(data.stats.gunRightsTotal)}
    label="total gun rights"
    lg
  />
  <Stat
    unit="$"
    value={commaNumber(data.stats.gunControlTotal)}
    label="total gun control"
    lg
  />
</StatGrid>

<Lobbying data={data.lobbying} />

## The data

Every member of Congress is required to file their funders with the federal government (FEC). However, though the data is technically public, it’s inaccessible—so Gun Funded tries to make it easy to visualize & understand.

### A note on objectivity

The site attempts to authentically and neutrally present its data, but objectivity doesn’t really exist. The entire premise of the website—that this specific data is worth looking at—is a political statement in itself.

I made this site because I think it’s most important that regardless of where people stand on gun issues, everyone should know about our representatives’ funding, on both sides of the issue.

### Sources

The funding data all comes from the [Center for Responsive Politics](https://www.opensecrets.org). The site does not update live, only because the data only meaningfully changes with each election every two years.

The basic information about each member (including social media) comes from [theunitedstates.io](https://theunitedstates.io).

### Deconstructing a profile

<Profile
  data={data.profiles.sample}
  full
  sx={{ h2: { mt: '0 !important', mb: 0 } }}
/>

- The first row is money in support of a candidate on **gun rights** (“rights” = against placing restrictions on firearms, typically more Republican)
- The second row is in support of **gun control** (“control” = supports placing restrictions on firearms, typically more Democratic)
- The first column is **direct contributions**: groups like the NRA & Everytown directly giving money to a candidate
- The second two columns are **independent expenditure**: those groups running ads to support/oppose candidates, funneling money through other organizations

- **Total**: the total money given to the member’s campaign or leadership PAC from gun rights or gun control PACs or individuals in all of CRP’s data (back to 1989 for members for whom that is relevant).
- **Support/oppose:** numbers are money spent by outside groups supporting and opposing these candidates. _Gun rights support_, for example, shows money spent by gun rights groups on independent expenditures supporting this candidate.
- **Net funding** (internal) is gun rights funding _(gun rights total, gun rights support, gun control opposition)_ **minus** gun&nbsp;control funding _(gun control total, gun control support, gun rights opposition)_
- **Ranking** uses the net funding amount—from most gun rights to most gun control, with those with zero funding in the middle. (If it was ranked without gun control, there would be <span children={data.stats.unRightsCount} /> people with no gun rights funding who can’t really be ranked)
